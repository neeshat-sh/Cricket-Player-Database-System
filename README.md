# Cricket-Player-Database-System
This project is a cricket player database management application created as part of my Level 1 Term 2 coursework. The application combines Java networking and JavaFX for a seamless graphical and functional experience.

## Features
1. Player Search: Search players based on various metrics.
2. Player Management: Add new players to the database.
3. Club Transactions: Buy and sell players between clubs, simulating IPL-like player trading.
4. Self-Contained Setup: Includes all required libraries, including the JavaFX SDK, for easy execution.
## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or above.
- JavaFX SDK: Already included in the lib folder of this repository.
## Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/neeshat-sh/Cricket-Player-Database-System.git
    cd Cricket Player Database System
    ```
    [note: If EOF is reached prematurely due to internet disconnection while receiving objects, changing to HTTP version 1.1 and increasing the buffer size might help. You might also need to change your internet network from wifi to data connection.]
    Optionally, if clone fails, do the following and try again.
    ```
    git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1
    git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400
    ```
    You can revert back to your original HTTP version once cloned successfully.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Ensure the JavaFX SDK from the lib folder is correctly configured in your project's library path.
4. Build and run the project from your IDE.
## Future Improvements
- User Interface Enhancements: Develop a more intuitive and visually appealing UI.
- Extended Functionality:
    1. Enable editing player details.
    2. Allow clubs to set player prices.
    3. Introduce features like bidding for players between clubs.
